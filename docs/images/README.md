## kafka-metamorphosis.png

Please save the cockroach image as `kafka-metamorphosis.png` in this directory.

The image should be the classic illustration of a cockroach (like the one from Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis") to maintain the thematic connection between the literary work and this Kafka (Apache Kafka) library.

You can convert and save the attached cockroach image here to complete the README setup.
